We can perform 2 ways of Communication between 2 Microservices
1. Synchronous Communication : HTTP/HTTPS
2. Asynchronous Communication : Apache KAfka / Rabbit MQ

A. Under Synchronous Communication
   1. Rest Template
   2. WebClient
   3. Open Feign


                                            1. Rest Template

       Requirements:
       1. Consider Employee belongs to a department.
          & Employee has a unique Department code.
       2. Change GET Employees REST API to return Employee along with its Department Code in response.

        Development Steps:
        1. Add Department Code field in Employee Entity.
        2. Create Department DTO class
        3. Configure Rest Template as Spring Bean
        4. Inject and use Rest Template to make REST API call in EmployeeServiceImpl

        What we basically did here is :
        Created a field departmentCode in Employee Entity.
        And Also Did the same in Employee DTO.
        Created the Department DTO.
        Created a Bean of Rest Template
        Injected that into the ServiceImpl class

        ResponseEntity<DepartmentDto> responseEntity = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8082/api/departments/"+ employee.getDepartmentCode(), DepartmentDto.class);
        DepartmentDto departmentDto = responseEntity.getBody();

        Then Created a Separate APIResponseDTO which will have both employeeDto & departmentDto
        And Return that APIResponseDto(both employee details & department details) in the REST API getemployeeById.
        (As They have employee and department table has departmentCode in common)

        Rest Template will be deprecated so spring advices us to use webClient.




                                         2. Web Client

      Now Lets see how to use Web Client to make REST API call from employee service to Department service.
      Web-Client is a modern API which supports Sync , Async and streaming scenarios.

      Web-Client is a part of Spring Web Flux Dependency.
      Web-Client is a Reactive HTTP Client.

      Development Steps:
      1. Add Spring WebFlux Dependency
      2. Configure WebClient as Spring Bean
      3. Inject and use WebClient to Call the REST API
      4. Test using Postman Client

                webClient.get()
                        .uri("http://localhost:8082/api/departments")   -> URL to get the department details
                        .retrieve()                                     -> we need to retrieve
                        .bodyToMono(DepartmentDto.class)                -> Return intype if DepartmentDTO
                        .block();                                       -> As a Synchronous call
